`Developer Mode` is a feature to speed up developing games with OpenAphid-Engine. The behavior of OpenAphid-Engine changes if the developer mode is turned on.

## How to Enable Developer Mode?

Open your project with Xcode and locate the following lines in `OAAppDelegate.m`:

``` objective-c
[self.viewController.glViewController configBundleName:@"game.bundle" 
                                               baseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://129.158.217.36:18080"]
                                           developMode:YES];
```

1. Setting the value of the `developMode` parameter to `YES` enables the developer mode of OpenAphid-Engine;

2. An HTTP server should be used to host the content inside the bundle folder specified by `configBundleName`. The value for the `baseURL` parameter should be set to the server address too. A ruby based tiny HTTP server is included in our boilerplate project, please refer to the `web_server.rb` and `start_dev_server.sh` files for more details;

3. The application should be built and re-deployed to devices with the new settings.

And for the [Boilerplate-iOS](https://github.com/openaphid/Boilerplate-iOS) project, `UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend` is `YES` in its info.plist file; which makes the app terminate automatically when the Home button is pressed.

## Changes in Developer Mode

The main benefit of using developer mode is that it makes the game development speedy like developing for web:

- JavaScript files are fetched from the HTTP server. If you want to see the result of your changes in the game script, you only need to re-open the app;

- Graphics resources are fetched remotely too. For example, a texture can be created by using `new aphid.g2d.Texture2D("player.png")`; the `player.png` file is fetched via `http://129.158.217.36:18080/player.png` in developer mode. OpenAphid-Engine Runtime also prints a log about it as following:

```
INFO 05/02/12,13:41:32: (developer mode) loading data 'player.png' from remote: http://129.158.217.36:18080/player.png
```

- Internal warning and error messages are displayed as on-screen notifications besides logging in device console. Warning messages are in blue background color and errors are in red color. The screenshot below shows a notification about a syntax error at line 17 in main.js:

![Error Notification](/images/developer-mode-error-notification.png "Notification")

- Messages produced by `console.warn` and `console.error` are also displayed as notifications;

- Write access to read-only attributes of OpenAphid-Engine objects throws exception in developer mode.

With the developer mode of OpenAphid-Engine, the typical development process is as follows:

1. Developer edits the JavaScript file with game logics and updates graphic files inside the bundle folder;

2. Presses the home button and enters the app again to see the result of the changes;

3. Following the on-screen notifications and console logs to diagnose mistakes in JavaScript files.

Hope you like the developer mode of OpenAphid-Engine. We'll improve it constantly to make game development easier. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions.
