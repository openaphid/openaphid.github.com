AphidMobile is pleased to announce the availability of OpenAphid-Engine v0.2.

Highlights of the v0.2 release include:

<!-- more -->

- New binding system for exposing Objective-C methods to JavaScript
- Hide `constructor` when enumerating attributes of an OpenAphid-Engine JavaScript object
- Fix incorrect value of `node.onframeupdate` when it's not set; should be `null` instead of an invalid empty value
- Add a new target of `ObjCBindingTest` in [Demos](https://github.com/openaphid/Demos)
- Support Google Analytics iOS SDK in [Boilerplate-iOS](https://github.com/openaphid/Boilerplate-iOS)

A new tutorial is coming in this week to introduce the new binding system for exposing Objective-C functions into JavaScript. Please stay tuned!
